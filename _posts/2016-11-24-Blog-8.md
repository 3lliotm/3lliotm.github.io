    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>This week I had to carry on from my work last week as not very hard apart from the fact we had a error stopping us.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Not to complete satisfaction, because the error was stopping me from keeping me on my time schedule and sometimes I was getting distracted as I was getting bored.</td>
