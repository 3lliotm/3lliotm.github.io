During today's lesson i had a blast of a time. Learning to have one image on my website, deleting my old (useless) blogs and finally being able to show that people how proud i really am.

This lesson took me a lot of effort. I had to push myself to my effort limits, struggling to have the will to produce this beautiful creation.

To be able to reach my goals, i had to look on the w3 schools website to give me a few tips and pointers in the right direction

All in all i think i have produced a decent amount of work for one lesson.
