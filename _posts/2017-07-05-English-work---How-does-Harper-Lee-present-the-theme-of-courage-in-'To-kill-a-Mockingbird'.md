Courage in 'To Kill a Mockingbird'

Written by Harper Lee, and set in the 1930s the town of Maycomb there is full of prejudice people and throughout chapters 1-15, Harper Lee creates lots of situations to show courage. This courage comes from lots of people but more than anyone, Atticus Finch is shown to be a very courageous man. Atticus teaches his kids right from wrong and lives by his own lessons. It is said by Harper Lee that **"If Atticus Finch drank until he was drunk he wouldn't be as hard as some men are at their best".**

In chapter seven, jem and scout go to the radley place to investigate Boo Radley. After Jem had lost his pants at the Radley place, he went back to try and find them. This shows a great deal of courage from Jem as he is going into a place which has had bad things said about it. Although Jem is a young boy I think that he has got this courage from his father, Atticus, and by learning from him he has been able to face this situation and in the end there was a good outcome. If Jem hadn't hadn't gone back to the Radley place, he may have got in trouble at home and his dad would have been ashamed of him for going to such a place.

During chapter ten a mad dog named Tim Johnson is out on the road and is everyone is very cautious. When Atticus has to shoot the dog he shows more bravery than before as this means his children now know that he is a pro shooter and has the name 'one shot Finch' another way that this shows courage is by the fact that he has had to put someone's dog down and is now going to have to live with that in the back of his mind forever. Atticus’ children do not know that he is a good shooter and when Jem and Scout talk about it Jem says "Atticus is a gentleman, just like me" this tells is that even after Atticus has killed a living animal, his children still think highly of him.

Dill, is also a very courageous person who shows bravery even at the toughest of times. Part way through chapter fourteen, Jem and Scout find Dill Under scout's bed, although this wasn't a very clever thing to do it still shows lots of courage from Dill. Dill shows that he is not frightened of the consequences of his actions by saying "I'm not scared…" although it is not a very meaningful sentence it still shows that he is able to speak for himself and not just shy away from the truth.

Once again, Atticus shows lots of courage during chapter fifteen. Whilst defending, the black, Tom Robinson after being unreasonable accused of rape on a white women. The courage from Atticus shown here is very important as even though he is not very likely to win the case he still try's as it is the right thing to do because the accusation was wrong. If he hadn't have taken the case his reputation may have been ruined and people would not talk so highly of him. Deas says to Atticus that he's "got everything to lose from this, Atticus I mean everything." and Atticus now has to make sure he doesn't do anything wrong as he may be seen as completely differently. 

Later on in chapter fifteen when Jem,Scout and Dill find Atticus outside the jail with other men. Jem shows courage by standing up to the men and not going home as he wants to protect his dad. Scout also does her but at this point and is very brave when she kicks a man in the shin, this could have gone completely wrong and she may have got herself in a bad situation but luckily she comes out okay.

Altogether I think that Atticus shows the most courage up to chapter sixteen as he always stands up for what he believes in and doesn't do much wrong. He is a great father and his children think highly of him, they also follow his steps and stand up for themselves as well.
