To make my github website clearer and more presentable, I had to change the font and font colour.

This improved the quality of my github so much and has made me feel better about myself and a more influenced person.

I am now very happy as my github is looking stylish.

My new background has also made a extreme change to my github as it now looks like a car enthusiast's blog. I was hoping to have a good page which shows that the owner likes cars and i am happy to say that that's what i have ended up with.

All in all, a great way to end the day and make my blog better :)
