    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>My target for this lesson was to be able to change my font so that it could brighten up my website and make it look more appeasing to the reader.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, by digging around on w3 schools to find the section and piece of code I needed. I was able to incorporate it into my website easily.</td>

    <td>I learnt that it is more useful to search up what you need straight away rather than ask the pupils in your class who give you useless information that doesn't work.</td>
