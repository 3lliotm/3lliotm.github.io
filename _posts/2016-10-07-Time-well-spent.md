Guess what guys?

Just managed to use my spare time to change the font colour on my website.

What you need to do is go to HTML color picker, yes i know its spelt wrong. But anyway choose the colour you fancy and copy the rgb line.

Then go to your style scss section and copy it in then voila and when your website has been reloaded the font colour would have changed.
