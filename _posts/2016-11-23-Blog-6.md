    <td>Okay website. I had a good, clear colour scheme. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>My target for this lesson was to be able to change my background so it did not have reapers all around the website. (Only one image no matter how far in and or out you zoom.)</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, by digging around on w3 schools to find the section and piece of code I needed.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learnt that it is more useful to search up what you need straight away rather than ask the pupils in your class who give you useless information that doesn't work.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was not limited very much at all as I got on with my work and didn't get distracted as much as I nor may would.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>Next time all I would change to improve my learning would be to, try and get more work done productively in the time I have at school as then I would be able to get more work done at home to make my blogs even better.</td>
